- methods prefer the data to be in scope all at once
- serialisation prefer the data to be split into structs corresponding to lifetimes (config, savefile, transient)

- solution:
  ? code generation: specify data separately, generate extra access properties
  + don't bother separating the data in memory by lifetime, write serialisation code (ala augustus)



game
  config
  current_scenario
    config
    city
    
    
- settings
- persistent
- transient


for the game, the current scenario is transient, but scenario is saved separately and has its own persistent data


- should the game transient state store only the scenario id?


loading
  - start of a game
    - load game.config
  - load save file
    - load game.persistant
    - load scenario.config
    - load scenario.persistant
    
    
- scenario config is part of game.persistent conceptually, but should be loaded separately
