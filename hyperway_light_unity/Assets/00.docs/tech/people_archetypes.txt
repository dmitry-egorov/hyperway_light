- in the first iteration implements as part of a house

- makes sense to make it a separate archetype for now

archetype
  - separate archetype + entity for rendering
    - entity references the person and vice versa
    - will need to have disabled entities, probably a lot of them
  - entity archetype
  
  
- people are often inside buildings and so don't need the entity part
