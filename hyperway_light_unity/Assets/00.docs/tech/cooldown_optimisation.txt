- can make some checks every few frames
- can check a few entities each frame


global timer check instead of writing remaining
- n = global tick number
- s = start time
- c = cooldown
- predicate: (n + o) % c = 0

reset: s = n
check: n - s >= c









a queue of events
  - nodes:
    - skip_time
    - do_event:
      - for each type of event?
      - list of ids of entities that need to do something on this frame
  - modification
    - insert event:
      - find a place in the queue, where the event needs to be inserted
    - process queue:
      - take the first node
        - if skip_time
          - reduce cooldown
          - if cooldown is zero -> pop the node
        - if do_event
          - take all entities and apply functions to them
          - pop the node
