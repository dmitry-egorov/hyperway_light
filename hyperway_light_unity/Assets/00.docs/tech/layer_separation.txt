separate scenes:
- game_common
- main_menu ui
- city
  - common
  - ui
  - campaign
  - scenario
  - runtime

- separation options:
  - separate simulation from everything else
    - how to save UI state (if it's required)
    - how to determine the order of operations? (dependencies)
    - ecs reusability?
  - separate game from rendering
    - can use unity as a renderer, editor and platform only
    - need to implement extra logic:
      - collisions
      - raycasting
