- start simple:
  - house (family) has hunger level
  - regularly, hunger level is increased by 1
  - family consumes 1 food if their hunger level is above 1
  - if the hunger level reaches 3, the family dies

integral:
  if (has_food) consume food
  else          consume population (how many?)

individual:
  - person has health
  - periodically he needs to consume food or he takes damage
  - when the health is zero, he dies
  more details:
  - hunger increases periodically
  - after each increase
    - if hunger = max -> take 1 damage
  - each food consumptions resets the hunger to zero
    
  impl:
    health_max          // maximum health
    health              // current health
    hunger

    hunger_max          // maximum hunger
    hunger_cd           // hunger increase cooldown
    hunger_eating_level // amount of hunger when the person starts looking for food
