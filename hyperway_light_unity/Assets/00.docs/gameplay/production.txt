- batch starts producing when all the requirements are met
- allow overflow? (no for now)
- factories can set production recipes (can have different cost/output/time)

- recipes has allowed building type? (instead of building having a fixed recipe)

- resources should be produced in batches:
  - produce x resources every y ticks
  - should the buildings have individual ticks or shared?
  - probably individual, since production consumes resources (no resources -> no tick)
  - the batch should specify:
    - amount of resources produced
    - time to produce
    - required resource to produce
  - does the producer consume resources continuously or once per batch?
    - the difference is only in fractions



e.g.
  - mine produces 10 matter every 10 seconds for 2 energy
    - consume:
      + at the start of production
      - (no) 1 energy at the start, 1 energy after 5 seconds
      
      
same as:
  - Caesar 3, K&M: batch has input, all of it is consumed to make the output
